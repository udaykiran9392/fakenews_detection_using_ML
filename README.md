# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This solution aims to support media platforms, fact-checkers, and cybersecurity efforts in mitigating misinformation across the internet.

## 🔍 Overview
Misinformation is a global challenge, particularly on digital platforms where fake news can go viral in minutes. This project leverages Python, NLP, and ML algorithms to build a classification model capable of detecting misleading or false content. The model utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression to analyze news headlines or body text and predict authenticity with high accuracy.

provides a real-world utility in promoting digital truth and transparency.

## 📚 About the Project
The dataset used contains thousands of news headlines labeled as fake or real. After cleaning the data, textual content is converted into a numerical format using TF-IDF Vectorization. Multiple machine learning classifiers are then trained and evaluated.

**Key Models:**

Logistic Regression

PassiveAggressiveClassifier

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Final model achieved ~94% accuracy, demonstrating strong potential for real-world deployment.


## 🧠 Project Workflow

**Data Collection & Loading**

Imported a labeled dataset (real vs. fake news) via Google Drive into Google Colab.

**Text Preprocessing**

Cleaned and normalized text using:

- Stopword Removal

- Stemming

- Lowercasing & Punctuation Removal

- TF-IDF Vectorization

**Model Training**

Trained classifiers:

✅ Logistic Regression

✅ PassiveAggressiveClassifier

✅ Naive Bayes (optional for comparison)

**Evaluation**

Assessed model using:

- Accuracy Score

- Precision, Recall, F1-Score

- Confusion Matrix


**Insights**

- Identified keywords and patterns more common in fake news

- Final model achieved ~94% accuracy
